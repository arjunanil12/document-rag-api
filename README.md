# Document Management and RAG-based Q&A API

---

### üöÄ **Overview**

This API provides a comprehensive solution for document management, embedding-based retrieval, and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-driven Q&A system. It allows users to efficiently ingest documents, store them with embeddings, and retrieve relevant chunks based on queries. Using **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL (pgvector)**, **HuggingFace embeddings**, and **Ollama LLM**, this system provides both fast document retrieval and intelligent, context-aware Q&A capabilities.

### üõ† **Technologies Used**

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python. It handles RESTful API endpoints efficiently.
- **PostgreSQL (pgvector)**: A reliable database used to store document embeddings and metadata, with fast similarity search support.
- **HuggingFace Embeddings**: Pre-trained models for generating document chunk embeddings to enable semantic search.
- **Ollama LLM (llama3.1:8b)**: A language model used to provide intelligent, context-based answers for queries based on relevant document chunks.
- **Docker**: For containerizing PostgreSQL and Ollama, ensuring a consistent development environment.

### üîß **Installation & Setup**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Unzip the Folder**  
Unzip the folder and set it as the current working directory:
```
cd document-rag-api
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Running with Docker (Full Setup)**  
To start the entire application using Docker Compose (which includes PostgreSQL, Ollama, and FastAPI), simply run:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

**Note:**  
- Ensure you use the `docker.env` file as the `.env` configuration for this setup.
- This will bring up all the components: **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Ollama**.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Running Fully Locally**  
Install the necessary Python dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Run PostgreSQL**  
To run PostgreSQL in Docker, use:
```
docker-compose up -d postgres
```

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Run FastAPI Application Manually**  
Start the FastAPI application using `uvicorn`:
```
cd src
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### üì° **API Endpoints**

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Document Ingestion API**  
- **POST** `/ingest`
  - Uploads a document, extracts text, generates embeddings, and stores them in the database.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Retrieval API**  
- **GET** `/retrieve`
  - Retrieves the top K most relevant document chunks based on a query.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Q&A API**  
- **GET** `/qna/query`
  - Uses the RAG-based system to retrieve relevant chunks and generate context-aware answers.

For detailed examples and API documentation, please refer to the [API Endpoints section](#api-endpoints).

### üî¥ **Planned Features & Missing Implementations**

- **Enhanced Document Ingestion**:
  - Support for multiple file types (e.g., HTML, CSV, JSON).
  - Semantic chunking and duplicate removal.

- **Advanced Query Processing**:
  - Query rewriting and expansion (e.g., synonyms, keyword expansion).
  - Result re-ranking and hybrid search (combining BM25 and semantic search).

- **Retriever Optimization**:
  - HNSW Indexing for faster vector retrieval.
  - Query routing optimizations.

- **Security & Multi-Tenancy**:
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-tenancy support.
  - Input filtering for harmful queries.

---

### üß™ **Testing Strategy**

- The project uses **pytest** for unit testing. Tests can be found in the `tests/` directory.
- **pytest.ini** has been configured to ensure proper test execution.

### üìù **Note**

I initially envisioned building the entire system from scratch, including custom integration with PostgreSQL, and without the use of external libraries like Langchain and LlamaIndex. As a result, Docker was integrated even for the normal setup to streamline the environment. Due to workload constraints and other personal challenges, I wasn't able to complete all aspects of this project as initially planned. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.
